# Professional Interests
I'm really interested in applications of Computer Science towards other fields (like bioinformatics). I hope to utilize this in my later career towards bioinformatics research and/or healthcare applications. Outside of my classes, I spend a lot of time working in the Saier Lab, Sanchez-Roige Lab, and CAIDA (all at UCSD). Research has been my favorite part of my time at UCSD and I hope to continue carrying out similar work in whatever career I end up pursuing. 

You can view one my projects from the Saier Lab at [this link](https://github.com/gauthamp123/microbiome_project). If you want to take a look at the codebase, you can run the following command: `https://github.com/gauthamp123/microbiome_project.git`. The project helps to classify and annotate unknown proteomic sequences within novel bacterial species. It's been years in the making and I'm glad it's almost finished. 

In addition to this project, I also have one at the Sanchez-Roige lab, though, due to the nature of the project (working with personal health information), I'm unable to share it here. It is hoping to better understand Opioid Use Disorder and correlate how the circumstances and response to a patient's first exposure to opiates impacts their risk for developing a disorder later in life. I'm working on quality control and data cleaning as well as some preliminary data exploration. It's been difficult due to how large the dataset is and how variable these survey results can be. It's important to be thorough with the whole process and there's been a number of setbacks, but it's exciting work. 

# Personal Interests
Aside from my professional aspirations, my interests include items in the below list:
1) Reading
    - Recently I've enjoyed reading "The Song of the Cell," the "A Song of Ice and Fire" series, 
2) Watching TV
    - Some stuff I've seen recently includes "Dune 2", "Bramayugam", "Game of Thrones", and "True Detective"
3) Photography
    - I've been taking pictures of hiking trails, national parks, and whatever flora and fauna I encounter. 

Here's one of the pictures I've taken:

# Goals
Some goals I've set for myself this quarter are:
[ ] Maintain or improve your current GPA
[ ] Read at least two books 
[x] Secure a summer position
[ ] Hit the gym at least 4 times a week 
[ ] Spent less time online or in front of a screen 
[ ] Spend more time relaxing and less time working 
[ ] Finish up editing your publication 
[ ] Start preparing for the MCAT 

These goals are important to both my personal and professional aspirations and will ensure I continue to work towards graduate school while working towards a healthier and more satisfying lifestyle.
